/* Weather Observation Station 5
Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths
(i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one
that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
Hereâ€™s the table representation of the STATION table as shown in the image, ready to copy:

Station table: 
+-----------+---------------+
|    file   |     type      |
+-----------+---------------+
| id        | number        |
| city      | varchar2 (21) |
| state     | varchar2 (2)  |
| lat_n     | number        |
| long_w    | number        |
+-----------+---------------+ 
where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Sample Input
For example, CITY has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY.

Sample Output
ABC 3
PQRS 4

Explanation

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with lengths 3, 3, 4 and 3.
The longest name is PQRS, but there are 3 options for shortest named city. Choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

Note: You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query. */

/* ANSWER

-- QUERY 1
-- Select the city with the shortest name and its length
SELECT TOP 1 city, LEN(city) AS name_length
-- The data is retrieved from the station table
FROM station
-- Order by the length of the city name in ascending order
-- If two cities have the same length, order alphabetically by city name
ORDER BY LEN(city), city;

-- QUERY 2
-- Select the city with the longest name and its length
SELECT TOP 1 city, LEN(city) AS name_length
-- The data is retrieved from the station table again
FROM station
-- Order by the length of the city name in descending order
-- If two cities have the same length, order alphabetically by city name
ORDER BY LEN(city) DESC, city;
